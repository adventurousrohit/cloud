                            We generally recommend a control panel to manage and operate the VPS. All customers who have a plain VPS would have to configure the DNS, user accounts, mail accounts, and other such activities about the configuration of such VPSs themselves.

                            <p> 
                          
                            a) What “Unlimited” means

Unlimited Disk Space/Bandwidth/Website Plans. This means that we do not set a limit on the amount of bandwidth, websites, or disk space you may use in the normal operation of a personal or small business website, provided it complies with this Agreement.
<br /> <br />
However, in the event your service usage or content presents a risk to the stability, performance, or uptime of our servers, data storage, networking, or other infrastructure, you may be required to upgrade to a VPS, or we may take action to restrict the resources your website is utilizing.
<br /> <br />
b) What “Unlimited” DOES NOT mean
<br /> <br />
Cloudminister Technologies employs complex mechanisms to protect its hosting Subscribers and systems from any kind of abuse. Cloudminister Technologies’ “Unlimited” hosting offering is not for single or few hosting subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other hosting Subscribers.
<br /> <br />
Cloudminister Technologies’ service is offering a shared hosting service, which means that multiple hosting Subscriber’s websites are hosted from the same server and share server resources. Cloudminister Technologies’ service is designed to meet the typical needs of small and medium-sized businesses across the globe. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, or non-typical applications better suited to a VPS or a dedicated server.
<br /> <br />
Cloudminister Technologies will make every commercially reasonable effort to provide additional resources to Subscribers who are using their website(s) consistent with these Terms, including moving Subscribers to newer and bigger shared servers as necessary.
<br /> <br />
However, in order to ensure a consistent and quality experience for all Subscribers, Cloudminister Technologies does place automated safeguards to protect against any website growing too quickly and adversely impacting the system until Cloudminister Technologies can evaluate said site’s resource needs.
<br /> <br />
c) Unlimited Hosting Space; excessive SQL Database
<br /> <br />
